## Project Functionality

The app provides users with a content library, encompassing a diverse collection of movies and TV shows. Users can effortlessly search for specific content by entering the title in the search bar. A bookmarking functionality enables users to mark their favorite movies and TV shows.

The navigation is facilitated through intuitive tabs, enabling transitions between different content categories such as "Movies," "TV Series", "Bookmarks" and others. Upon selecting a movie or TV show card, users are presented with a detailed view that includes plot summaries, cast information, release dates, and user ratings. Lazy loading is implemented to optimize performance. Content cards and components are loaded on-scroll, reducing initial loading times and enhancing overall user experience.
